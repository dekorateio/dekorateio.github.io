Dekorate is a collection of compile time generators and decorators of Kubernetes manifests.
It makes generating and decorating Kubernetes manifests as simple as adding a dependency to your project.
No editing of xml, yml or json is required. Everything is done via:

- The standard configuration mechanism of your framework.
- Java annotations.
- Auto adapting to your code.

And the best part is that its language and build tool independant!
